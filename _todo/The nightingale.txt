[Intro]
Gather 'round, lads

[Verse 1]
As I went a walking one morning in May
I spied a young couple who fondly did stray
And one was a young maid so sweet and so fair
And the other was a soldier and a bold grenadier

[Pre-Chorus]
And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
Sing along, boys:

[Chorus]
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother
They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together
To hear the nightingale sing

[Verse 2]
Out of his knapsack he took a fine fiddle
And he played her such a merry tune that you ever did hear
He played her such a merry tune that the valley did ring
Oh soft cried the family as the nightingale sings

[Pre-Chorus]
And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other

[Chorus]
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother
They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing

[Verse 3]
Well, I'm off to India for seven long years
Drinking wines and strong whiskies instead of small beer
And if ever I return again it will be in the spring
And we'll both sit down together
To hear the nightingale sing
"Well then", said the fair maid, "Will you marry me?"
"Oh no", says the soldier, "How well can that be?"
For I have my own wife at the banks of the D
And she is the fairest damsel that you ever did see

[Chorus]
And they kissed so sweet and comforting
As they clung to each other
They went arm in arm along the road
Like sister and brother
They went arm in arm along the road
'Til they came to a stream
And they both sat down together, love
To hear the nightingale sing
