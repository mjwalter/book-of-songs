I'm lookin' for a stone was
Hewed out of the mountain
Lookin' for a stone was
Rollin' down from Babylon
I'm lookin' for a stone was
Hewed out of the mountain
Tearin' down the kingdom of this world

My father's in that stone was
Hewed out the mountain
My father's in that stone was
Rollin' down from Babylon
My father's in that stone was
Hewed out the mountain
Tearin' down the kingdom of this world

My mother's in that stone was
Hewed out the mountain
My mother's in that stone was
Rollin' down from Babylon
My mother's in that stone was
Hewed out the mountain
Tearin' down the kingdom of this world

My people's in that stone was
Hewed out the mountain
My people's in that stone was
Rollin' down from Babylon
My people's in that stone was
Hewed out the mountain
Tearin' down the kingdom of this world

I'm lookin' for a stone was
Hewed out of the mountain
Lookin' for a stone was
Rollin' down from Babylon
I'm lookin' for a stone was
Hewed out of the mountain
Tearin' down the kingdom of this world
Tearin' down the kingdom of this world
Tearin' down the kingdom of this world
