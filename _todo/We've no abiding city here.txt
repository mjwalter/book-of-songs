"We've no abiding city here,"
This may distress the worldling's mind;
But should not cost a saint a tear,
Who hopes a better rest to find.

"We've no abiding city here,"
Sad truth were this to be our home;
But let this thought our spirits cheer,
"We seek a city yet to come."

"We've no abiding city here,"
Then let us live as pilgrims do;
Let not the world our rest appear;
But let us haste from all below.

"We've no abiding city here,"
We seek a city out of sight:
Zion it's name,—the Lord is there,
It shines with everlasting light.

O! sweet abode of peace and love,
Where pilgrims freed from toil are blest!
Had I the pinions of the dove,
I'd flee to thee, and be at rest.

But hush, my soul, nor dare repine!
The time my God appoints is best:
While here, to do his will be mine;
And his to fix my time of rest.

—Thomas Kelly (AD 1769–1855)
