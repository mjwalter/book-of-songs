As time draws near, my dearest dear\\*
When you and I must part\\
How little you know of the grief and woe\\*
In my poor aching heart

Each night I suffer for your sake\\*
Believe me, dear heart true\\
I wish that you were staying here\\*
Or I was going with you

\versemark
I wish my breast were made of glass\\*
Wherein you might behold\\
Upon my heart your name lies wrote\\*
In letters made of gold

In letters made of gold, my love\\*
Believe me when I say\\
You are the darling of my heart\\*
Until my dying day

\versemark
The blackest crow that ever flew\\*
Would surely turn to white\\
If ever I prove false to you\\*
Bright day would turn to night

Bright day would turn to night, my love\\*
The elements would mourn\\
If ever I prove false to you\\*
The seas would rage and burn
