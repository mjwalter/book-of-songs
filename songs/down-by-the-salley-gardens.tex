\versemark
Down by the salley gardens\\*
My love and I did meet;\\
She passed the salley gardens\\*
With little snow-white feet.

She bid me take love easy,\\*
As the leaves grow on the tree;\\
But I, being young and foolish,\\*
With her would not agree.

\versemark
In a field by the river\\*
My love and I did stand,\\
And on my leaning shoulder\\*
She laid her snow-white hand.

She bid me take life easy,\\*
As the grass grows on the weirs;\\
But I was young and foolish,\\*
And now am full of tears.
