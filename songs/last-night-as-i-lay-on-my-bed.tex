\songtitle{Last night as I lay on my bed}{\love}

\versemark
Last night as I lay on my bed\\*
I dreamed about a pretty fair maid\\
I was sore distressed, I could find no rest\\
Love did torment me so\\*
So away to my true love I did go

\versemark
When I arrived at my true love’s window\\*
I gently called her by her name\\
Saying, It’s for your sake that I come so late\\
Through the bitter frost and snow\\*
So open up the window my love do

\versemark
My mum and dad they are both awake\\*
And they are sure for to hear us speak\\
There’ll be no excuse, then but sore abuse\\
Many a bitter word and blow\\*
So begone from my window my love do

\versemark
Your mum and dad they are both asleep\\*
And they are sure not to hear us speak\\
They are speaking sound, in their bed of down\\
They draw their breath so low\\*
So open up the window my love do

\versemark
My love arose and opened up the door\\*
Just like an angel she stood on the floor\\
Her eyes shone bright, like the stars at night\\
No diamonds could shine so\\*
And in with my true love I did go
