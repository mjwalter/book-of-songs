Oh poor old Stormy’s dead and gone / To me\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Way hay, Stormalong}\\
Oh Stormy’s gone, that good old man\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Aye aye, Captain Stormalong}

\versemark
Well I wish I was old Stormy’s son\etc\\
I’d build a ship ten thousand ton\etc

\versemark
We’ll load her up with ale and rum\etc\\
That every shellback should have some\etc

\versemark
We'll dig his grave with a silver spade\etc\\*
His shroud of finest silk is made\etc

\versemark
We’ll lower him down with a silver chain\etc\\*
On every link is carved his name\etc

\versemark
And now we’ll sing his funeral song\etc\\*
Oh poor old Stormy’s dead and gone\etc
