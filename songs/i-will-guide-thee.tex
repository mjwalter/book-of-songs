\chorus{I will guide thee, I will guide thee,\\*
I will guide thee with mine eye;\\*
All the way from earth to heaven,\\*
I will guide thee with mine eye.}

\versemark
If you cannot sing like angels,\\*
If you cannot preach like Paul,\\
You can tell the love of Jesus,\\*
You can say he died for all.\refrain

\versemark
If you cannot give your thousands,\\*
You can give the widowâ€™s mite,\\
For the least you do for Jesus\\*
Will be precious in his sight.\refrain

\versemark
Hark the voice of Jesus calling;\\*
Who will come and work today?\\
Fields are ripe and harvest ready;\\*
Who will bear the sheaves away?\refrain
