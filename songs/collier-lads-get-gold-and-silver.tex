\songtitle{Collier lads get gold and silver}{\love\\\work}

\versemark
I went out to get some water,\\*
Get some water for my tea.\\
And I caught my foot and down I stumbled,\\*
A collier lad’s come kissing me.

\chorus{Collier lads get gold and silver,\\*
Factory boys get nowt but brass.
And who’d be married to a two-loom weaver\\*
When there’s plenty of collier lads?}

[Mum says I mustn’t have a collier,\\*
It would surely break her heart.\\
I don’t care what my mother tells me,\\*
I’ll have a collier for my sweetheart.]

\versemark
My mother said I could be a lady\\*
If from my collier lad I’d part,\\
I’d sooner walk on the bottom of the ocean\\*
Than I’d give up my collier sweetheart.\refrain

\versemark
If you leave your collier sweetheart\\*
I’ll buy you a guinea gold ring.\\
You shall have a silver cradle\\*
For to rock your baby in.\refrain

\versemark
I don’t want your silks and satins,\\*
I don’t want your guinea gold ring.\\
I don’t want your silver cradle\\*
For to rock my baby in.\refrain
