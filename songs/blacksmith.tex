\versemark
A blacksmith courted me, nine months and better\\*
He fairly won my heart, wrote me a letter.\\
With his hammer in his hand, he looked, he looked so clever\\*
And if I were with my love I would live forever

\versemark
Oh where has my love gone with his cheeks like roses?\\*
He’s gone across the sea, gathering primroses\\
I’m afraid the shining sun might burn and scorch his beauty\\*
And if I were with my love I would do my duty

\versemark
Strange news has come to town, strange news is carried\\*
Strange news flies up and down, that my love is married\\
I wish them both much joy though they don’t hear me\\*
And if I were with my love I would do my duty

\versemark
What did you promise me when you lay beside me?\\*
You said you’d marry me, and not deny me\\
— If I said I’d marry you, it was only for to try you\\*
So bring your witness, love, and I’ll not deny you

\versemark
Oh witness have I none, save for God almighty\\*
And may he reward you well for the slighting of me!\\
Her face grew pale and wan, and her lip, her lip did tremble\\*
For to think she had but one love, and he proved deceitful
