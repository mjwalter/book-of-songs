Come my lads, and let’s be jolly\\*
Drive away dull melancholy\\*
For to grieve it is a folly\\*

\chorus{Let union be in all our hearts\\*
Let all our hearts be joined as one\\*
We’ll end the day as we begun\\*
We’ll end it all in pleasure}

While we are together}

Solomon in all his splendour\\*
Still would praise and honour render\\*
To the People’s Pint’s bartender\\*
\vin\chorusfont{While we are together}\refrain

\versemark
Cease your quarreling and fighting\\*
Evil-speaking and backbiting\\*
All these things take no delight in\\*
\vin\chorusfont{While we are together}\refrain

% I’m so thirsty, I say Fuck it!
% I’d drink water from a bucket
% Whisky drinkers here can suck it!
% While we are together

[Time, my lads, for a libation\\*
As befits the situation\\
Water’s perfect for hydration\\*
\vin\chorusfont{While we are together}]

\versemark
Lift your glasses high and higher\\*
Drink whatever you desire\\*
Wine or water, beer or cider\\*
\vin\chorusfont{While we are together}\refrain
