\versemark
I am a poor, wayfaring stranger,\\
While journeying through this world of woe;\\*
Yet there’s no sickness, toil, nor danger\\
In that bright world to which I go.

I’m going there to see my father,\\*
I’m going there, no more to roam;\\
I’m only going over Jordan,\\*
I’m only going over home.

\versemark
I know dark clouds will gather round me,\\*
I know my way is rough and steep;\\
Yet beauteous fields lie just before me,\\*
Where God’s redeemed their vigil keep.

I’m going there to see my mother,\\*
She said she’d meet me when I come;\\
I’m only going over Jordan,\\*
I’m only going over home.

\versemark
I want to wear a crown of glory,\\*
When I get home to that good land;\\
I want to shout salvation’s story,\\*
In concert with the blood-washed band.

I’m going there to see my Savior,\\*
To sing his praise for evermore;\\
I’m only going over Jordan,\\*
I’m only going over home.
