\versemark
Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu Mormond Hill\\*
And the dear land of Crimmond, I bid you farewell\\
I’m bound off for Greenland and ready to sail\\*
In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale

\versemark
Farewell to my comrades, for a while we must part\\*
And likewise the dear lass who first won my heart\\
The cold coast of Greenland my love will not chill\\*
And the longer my absence, more loving she’ll feel

\versemark
Our ship is well rigged, and she’s ready to sail\\*
The crew they are anxious to follow the whale\\
Where the icebergs do float, and the stormy winds blow\\*
Where the land and the ocean is covered with snow

\versemark
The cold coast of Greenland is barren and bare\\*
No seedtime nor harvest is ever known there\\
And the birds here sing sweetly in mountain and dale\\*
But there’s no bird in Greenland to sing to the whale

\versemark
There is no habitation for a man to live there\\*
And the king of that country is the fierce Greenland bear\\
And there’ll be no temptation to tarry long there\\*
With our ship bumper full we will homeward repair

\versemark
Farewell to Tarwathie, adieu Mormond Hill\\*
And the dear land of Crimmond, I bid you farewell\\
I’m bound off for Greenland and ready to sail\\*
In hopes to find riches in hunting the whale
