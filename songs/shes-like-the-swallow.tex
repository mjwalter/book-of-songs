\songtitle{She’s like the swallow}{}

\annotation{This song may be sung with the first verse as a refrain.}

\versemark
She’s like the swallow that flies so high,\\*
She’s like the river that never runs dry;\\
She’s like the sunshine all on the lee shore,\\*
She loves her love but she’ll love no more.

\versemark
Down in the meadow this fair maid went,\\*
A-picking primroses just as she went;\\
The more she picked, oh, the more she pulled,\\*
Until she gathered her apron full.

\versemark
She climbed on yonder hill above\\*
To give a rose unto her love;\\
Well, she gave him one, she gave him three,\\*
She gave her heart for company.

\versemark
And as they sat on yonder hill\\*
His heart grew hard, and harder still;\\
He has two hearts instead of one—\\*
She says, Young man, what have you done?

\versemark
— How foolish, foolish you must be\\*
To think I love no one but thee;\\
The world’s not made for one alone,\\*
I take delight in everyone.

\versemark
She took her roses and made a bed,\\*
A stony pillow to rest her head;\\
She laid her down, no more to say,\\*
And let her roses fade away.

\versemark
She’s like the swallow that flies so high,\\*
She’s like the river that never runs dry;\\
She’s like the sunshine on the lee shore,\\*
She loves her love but she’ll love no more.
