\songtitle{Haul away Joe}{\sea\\\sturdy}

[When I was a little lad\\*
Or so my mother told me\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Way, haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe!}\\
That if I did not kiss the girls\\*
Me lips would all grow mouldy\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Way, haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe!}]

\chorus{Way, haul away, we’ll haul for better weather\\*
\vin Way, haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe!\\
Way haul away, we’ll haul away together\\*
\vin Way, haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe!}

[So list while I sing to you\\*
About me darling Nancy\\*
She’s copper-bottomed, clipper-built\\*
She’s just me style and fancy]

King Lewis was the king of France\\*
Before the revolution (to me!)\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Way, haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe!}\\
But then he got his head cut off\\*
Which spoiled his constitution (to me!)\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Way, haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe!}\refrain
