\chorus{I’m a rowdy soul, I’m a rowdy soul\\*
And I don’t care whether I work or not\\
I’m a rowdy soul, I’m a rowdy soul\\*
And I don’t care whether I work or not}

\versemark
I didn’t plant no corn this year\\*
Didn’t raise no beans or tomaters\\
Ground’s so poor that grass won’t grow\\*
But damn! them Irish potaters, oh

\versemark
When I get my new house built\\*
Gonna build my chimney higher\\
Don’t want no mud-daubers hanging around\\*
Putting out my fire, oh

\versemark
My captain got him a new blue coat\\*
Hung it in the hall\\
I stole down my captain’s coat\\*
And wore it to the ball

\versemark
Took my gal to the fancy ball\\*
Didn’t say nothing about it\\
I ain’t one to raise a row\\*
But I’m hell when I get started, oh

\versemark
Where’d you get your whiskey, boy?\\*
Where’d you get your dram?\\
Where’d you get your whiskey, boy?\\*
Well, I got it from Lincoln and Abraham!

\versemark
Now, you can’t do me like you done poor Shine.\\*
You taken his money, but you can’t take mine!\\
Ain’t but one man that I fear;\\*
That’s Big Jack Johnson, and he ain’t here!

\versemark
Well, come here, dog, and get your bone!\\*
Tell me which shoulder you want it on.\\
A penny off and a penny on;\\*
One more load and I’ll be gone!
