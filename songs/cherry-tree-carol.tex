Walked through an orchard green\\
There were cherries and berries\\*
As thick as might be seen\etc

Mary said to Joseph\\*
(So meek and so mild):\\
Joseph, gather me some cherries\\*
For I am with child\etc

Then Joseph flew in anger\\*
(In anger flew he):\\
Let the father of the baby\\*
Gather cherries for thee!\etc

Then up spoke baby Jesus\\*
From in Mary’s womb:\\
Bend down the tallest cherry\\*
That my mother might have some\etc

Then bent down the tallest cherry\\*
Till it touched Mary’s hand\\
Cried she: O look thou, Joseph\\*
I have cherries by command\etc

Then down fell old Joseph\\*
All onto one knee\\
Cyring, What have I done, Lord?\\*
Have mercy on me\etc\repeatfirst
