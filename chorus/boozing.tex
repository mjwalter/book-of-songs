Now what do you think I’ve been doing all day?\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Boozing, bloody well boozing!}\\
How do you think I’ve been spending my pay?\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Boozing, bloody well boozing!}

Don’t say I am wrong, though you know I’m not right;\\*
Don’t argue the point, for you know I can’t fight –\\*
But where would you like me to take you tonight?\\*
\vin\chorusfont{Boozing, bloody well boozing!}

\chorus{Boozing, boozing, when you are dry,\\*
Boozing, boozing, suits you and I;\\*
Some does it open, and some on the sly,\\*
But all of us likes to go boozing.}

Now what do the Salvation Army shoot down?\etc\\*
And what are they preaching in every town?\etc

They stand on street corners – they rave and they shout –\\*
They’re shameless and feisty, of that there’s no doubt –\\*
But what are they doing when their lights are gone out?\etcrefrain
