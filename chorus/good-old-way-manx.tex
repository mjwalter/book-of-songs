\versemark
Lift up your hearts, Emmanuel’s friends\\*
And taste the pleasure Jesus sends\\
Let nothing cause you to delay\\*
But hasten in the good old way

\chorus{For I have a sweet hope of glory in my soul\\*
I have a sweet hope of glory in my soul\\
For I know I have, and I feel I have\\*
A sweet hope of glory in my soul}

\versemark
Our conflicts here, though great they be\\*
Shall not prevent our victory\\
If we but strive and watch and pray\\*
Like soldiers in the good old way\refrain

\versemark
Though Satan may his powers employ\\*
Our happiness for to destroy\\
Yet never fear, we’ll gain the day\\*
By marching in the good old way\refrain

\versemark
Ye valiant souls, for heaven contend\\*
Remember glory is at the end\\
Our God will wipe our tears away\\*
When we have run the good old way\refrain

\versemark
And far beyond this mortal shore\\*
We’ll meet with those who have gone before\\
And shout to think we’ve gained the day\\*
By marching in the good old way\refrain
