\versemark
A gentleman was passing by\\
And he asked for a drink as he was dry\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
My cup is full up to the brim\\
And if I were to stoop I might fall in\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
If your true love was passing by\\
You’d fill him a drink if he was dry\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
She swore by grass, she swore by corn\\
Her true love had never been born\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
He said to her you’re swearing wrong\\
Six fine children you’ve had born\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
If you be a man of noble fame\\
You’ll tell to me the father of them\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
There’s one of them by your brother John\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\\
One of them by your Uncle Don\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\\
Two of them by your father dear\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
If you be a man of noble fame\\
You’ll tell to me what did happen to them\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
There’s one of them buried beneath the tree\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\\
Another two buried beneath the stone\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\\
Two of them outside the graveyard wall\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
If you be a man of noble fame\\
You’ll tell to me what will happen myself\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
You’ll be seven years a-ringing a bell\\
And seven years a-burning in hell\\*
\vin At the well below the valley-o\refrain

\versemark
I’ll be seven years a-ringing a bell\\
But the Lord may save me from burning in hell\\*
