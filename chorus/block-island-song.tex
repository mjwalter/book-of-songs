\versemark
Roll onward, ever roll, Deep surging ocean;\\
Wild is thy restless soul, Ever in motion.

\versemark
Waves round me ever flow, Swelling and leaping;\\
Winds round me keenly blow, Never are sleeping.

\versemark
Bravely on crests of foam, Bear thou me upward;\\
Loved ones wait me at home, Waft thou me onward.
