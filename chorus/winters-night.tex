\versemark
As I walked out on a winter’s night\\*
Drinking of sweet wine\\
Walking with the girl I love\\*
The one who stole this heart of mine

My love is like a red, red rose\\*
Newly sprung in June\\
And she is like a violin\\*
Sweetly played in tune

\chorus{So fare you well, my own true love\\*
Fare you well for a while\\
I’m going away, but I’m coming back\\*
If I walk ten thousand miles}

\versemark
Who will shoe your feet, my love?\\*
And who will glove your hand?\\
And who will kiss your ruby lips\\*
When I am gone for a foreign land

Father will shoe my feet, my love\\*
Mother will glove my hand\\
And you may kiss my ruby lips\\*
When you come back from a foreign land \refrain

\versemark
Don’t you see the lonesome dove\\*
Flying from vine to vine\\
She mourns the loss of her own true love\\*
And why not me for mine?

Ten thousand miles from you, my love\\*
You know that never could be\\
For if I lose my love for you\\*
That would be the death of me \doublerefrain
