\chorus{Leave her, Johnny, leave her
Oh leave her, Johnny, leave her
For the voyage is long and the winds don’t blow
And it’s time for us to leave her}

\versemark
Oh the wind was foul and the sea ran high\etc\\*
She shipped it green and none went by\etcrefrain

[Oh the skipper was bad but the mate was worse\etc\\*
He would blow you down with a spite and a curse\etc

I hate to sail on this rotten tub\etc\\*
No grog allowed and rotten grub\etc]

\versemark
Oh a dollar a day is a shellback’s pay\etc\\*
To pump all night and haul all day\etcrefrain

\versemark
We swear by rote for want of more\etc\\*
But now we’re through so we’ll go on shore\etcrefrain

\versemark
And now it’s time to say goodbye\etc\\*
For the old pierhead’s a-drawing nigh\etcrefrain
