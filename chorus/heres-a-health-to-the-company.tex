\versemark
Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme\\*
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine\\
Come lift up your voices, all grief to refrain\\*
For we may or might never all meet here again

\chorus{So here’s a health to the company and one to my lass\\*
Let’s drink and be merry all out of one glass\\
Let’s drink and be merry, all grief to refrain\\*
For we may or might never all meet here again}

\versemark
Here’s a health to the wee lass that I love so well\\*
For style and for beauty there’s none can excel\\
There’s a smile on her countenance as she sits upon my knee\\*
There is no man in this wide world as happy as me

\versemark
Our ship lies at anchor, she is ready to dock\\*
I wish her safe landing without any shock\\
And if ever I should meet you by land or by sea\\*
I will always remember your kindness to me \refrain
