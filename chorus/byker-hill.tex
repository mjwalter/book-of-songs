\notes{b \minor}{4/4}{b4}

If I had another penny\\*
I would have another gill\\
I would make the piper play\\*
The bonny lass of Byker Hill

\chorus{Byker Hill and Walker Shore\\*
Collier lads for ever more\\
Byker Hill and Walker Shore\\*
Collier lads for ever more}

The pitman and the keelman trim\\*
They drink bumble made from gin\\
Then to dance they all begin\\*
To the tune of the Elsie Marley \refrain

When first I went down to the dirt\\*
I had no cowl nor pitshirt\\
Now I've gotten two or three\\*
Walker Pit's done well by me \refrain

All the boys from Walker Shore\\*
Drink half a pint then eighteen more\\
All the way they rant and roar\\*
To the tune of the Elsie Marley \refrain

Geordie Charlton had a pig\\*
He hit it with a shovel and it danced a jig\\
All the way to Walker Shore\\*
To the tune of the Elsie Marley \refrain

If I had another penny\\*
I would have another gill\\
I would make the piper play\\*
The bonny lass of Byker Hill \refrain
