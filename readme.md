You must have LuaLaTex and LilyPond installed.

To compile, run `lualatex --shell-escape Book\ of\ songs.tex`.

To test a single file, uncomment the `includeonly` line towards the beginning of `Book of songs.tex` and substitute the file of your choice.

To create the indices, run `makeindex indexname` for each index you would like to create. Then move those to the `indices` folder.

The `Book of Songs.tex` file given uses a size of paper that works with A6 six-ring punch binders, but is slightly wider than A6 size. You can adjust the font and paper size as desired to meet your own needs.

Songs suspected to be protected by copyright have been omitted from the repository. If a song for which you own the copyright is listed in the contents, and you wish for it to be included here under the GNU General Public License v3.0, please contact me or leave a comment!
