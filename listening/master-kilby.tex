\songtitle{Master Kilby}{\love}

\versemark
In the heat of the day\\*
When the sun shines so freely,\\
I met Master Kilby\\*
So fine and so gay.

\versemark
Well, I pulled off my hat\\*
And I bowed to the ground,\\
And I said, Master Kilby,\\*
Oh where are you bound?

\versemark
— I’m bound for the west\\*
In hopes to find rest;\\
And in the arms of my dear Nancy\\*
I’ll build a new nest.

\versemark
And if I was the master\\*
Of ten thousand pounds\\
In bright gold and silver\\*
Or in King William’s crowns,

\versemark
I would part with it all\\*
With my own heart so freely:\\
It’s all for the sake\\*
Of my charming Nancy.

\versemark
She’s the fairest of girls,\\*
She’s the choice of my heart;\\
And her skin shines like silver\\*
In every part.

\versemark
Oh I gave her some kisses,\\*
It was down by the sea shore;\\
But still she lay asking,\\*
Lay asking for more.
