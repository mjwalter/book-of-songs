\versemark
In Bristol lived a lady\\*
She was scarce sixteen\\
Courted she was by many\\*
Her favor for to win

\versemark
But none of them could suit her\\*
Or please her to her mind\\
Until there came a drummer\\*
So loving and so kind

\versemark
Well the drummer he stepped up to her\\*
And he stole from her one kiss\\
He said, “Dear honoured lady,\\*
In the regiment will you enlist?”

\versemark
“Oh yes,” replied the lady,\\*
“This I’ll surely do,\\
For while I love your music sweet\\*
Likewise your rattatoo

\versemark
“And if you consent to marry\\*
Or to lie by my side,\\
I’ll buy your discharge my love\\*
In a carriage you will ride”

\versemark
“Oh yes,” replied the drummer\\*
“How happy I should be,\\
But I’m afraid that you won’t lie,\\*
with such a poor man as me”

\versemark
“Oh that you may depend on,”\\*
The lady made reply,\\
“For if I don’t wed with you, young man,\\*
I'll never be made a bride”

\versemark
This couple they got married\\*
With servants at their call,\\
And the drummer’s left off playing\\*
Among his comrades all

\versemark
But sometimes when the moon is high\\*
This drummer steals away,\\
And plays on his old army drum\\*
Till the dawning of the day
